I was born into the glove only to take it off.
Ah ah
I grew up with fear in my heart.
Then we gathered til my brothers both shot up.
It became clear there? s no one else here.
So I ask myself and I ask you now:
Will we go to heaven
Or will we go to hell?
It? s my understanding that neither are real.

Weeee ewww wee ewww

I grew up with fear in my heart
(X4)
Weeee ewww wee ewww
Weeee ewww wee ooooh
Will we go to heaven
Or will we go to hell?
It? s my understanding that neither are real.
(X4)
It became clear there? s no one else here.
